State Machine for ComicStudio

1/ Auto asking state diagram
	States
		idle
		wait 
		ask
		accept_question
		process_question
		answer

	Diragram
		wait:
			input(no_action) => idle
			input(no_action) [time_wait > wait_threshold[1]] => long_idle
		long_wait:
			input(no_action) => ask_owner
			input(no_action)[ask_too_much] => long_long_wait 
			input(no_action)[wait_too_much] => idle

		idle:
			input(no_action) => idle
	
		idle:
			input(data) => accept_question

		accept_question
			input(no_action) => default(no_action)
		
		process_question:
			input(no_action) => answer

		answer:
			input(no_action), output=answer => wait
	
2/ Note:
	2.1) Smoothly change states
		answer -> ready_answer -> wait -> idle -> long_idle
		
		=> The state machine should implement this by

		i) Doing a SmoothChange state machine 			

	2.2) Immediately change states
		answer --> long_idle 

	2.2) Smoothly upgrade states
 
3/ Primitive state machine
	SmoothChange:
		Constructor(list_of_smooth_states)
		step() = output is next state
		
	ExtraStateMachine
